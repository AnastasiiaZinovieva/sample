# Hello my dear friends!

## A python example

*average* is **sum** (bold) of elements devided by their **number** (bold)

To calculate the average we need to:
1. calculate sum (ordered list)
   1. initialize accumulator variable
   1. loop through elements
      * add each of them to the iterator
1. determine number of elements
1. divide by the number of elements

* sum may be:
  * integer
  * float

* average is (bold) **always** float
